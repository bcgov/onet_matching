## TL; DR

1)  **employment income of those who work full time full year:** Going from relatively well matched to relatively poorly matched causes a `r scales::percent(economic_effect, accuracy=.1)` reduction in employment income for those working full time, full year.

2)  **the probability of working full time full year:** Going from relatively well matched to relatively poorly matched causes a `r scales::percent(economic_effect2, accuracy=.1)` reduction in the probability of being employed full time full year.

## What is skill mis-match?

-   When the skills of a worker do not match the skills of their occupation.
-   Workers vary in terms of how well matched their skills are to the skill required by their occupation.
-   There are various reasons why people might be mis-matched... such as?
-   Given we are using observational (census) data we will want to control for these confounds.

## How do we measure skill mis-match?

-   Skill mis-match is the euclidean distance between the skill profile of an occupation and the skills possessed by a worker.
-   Occupation skill profiles easy to obtain from ONET skills and work activities.
-   Skills possessed by workers? We are going to have to get creative.

## Field of study skill profile:

-   We presume that a worker's skill profile is determined by their field of study.

## Example: Health and related fields

```{r}
DT::datatable(cip2_noc5, 
              extensions = 'Scroller',
              options = list(dom="t", 
                             deferRender = TRUE,
                             scrollY = 200,
                             scroller = TRUE), 
              rownames = FALSE)%>%
  DT::formatStyle(columns = colnames(cip2_noc5), fontSize = '50%')
```

## Skill profile of Health and related fields:

-   So in the previous table we derived weights $\omega_n$ associated with the $n$ occupations that account for more than one percent of the workers in a given field of study.
-   For a given skill $S$ and field of study $FOS$ we calculated the weighted mean of the skill score:

$$S_{FOS}=\sum^{n}_{NOC=1} \omega_n S_{NOC}$$

## Skill mis-match:

 heatmaply::heatmaply(dist_mat)
```

## Where do fields of study lead?

```{r, fig.retina=2, fig.width=30, fig.height=10}
filtered|>
  group_by(`NOC vs. Admin and financ...:`, `CIP vs. Agriculture...:`)|>
  count()|>
  ggplot(aes(axis1= `CIP vs. Agriculture...:`, axis2 = `NOC vs. Admin and financ...:`, y = n)) +
  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = `CIP vs. Agriculture...:`)) +
  geom_stratum() +
  ggfittext::geom_fit_text(stat = "stratum", aes(label = after_stat(stratum)), width = 1/3, min.size = 1) +
  labs(fill="Fields of Study")+
  theme_void()+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

## The Income Regression:

```{=tex}
\begin{multline}
\log(Employment~Income)=Age+Highest~Degree+ \\ Language+ Gender+ Ethnicity+Occupation \\ +Field~of~Study+distance+\mu
\end{multline}
```
## Plot of regression results:

```{r, fig.retina=2, fig.width=30, fig.height=10}
ggplot(mod1_coef, aes(estimate,
                     reorder_within(level, within=variable, by=estimate),
                     xmin=conf.low,
                     xmax=conf.high))+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, col="grey", lty=2)+
  geom_point(size=.5)+
  geom_errorbarh(height=0)+
  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = "free")+
  scale_y_reordered()+
  scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::percent)+
  labs(x=NULL,
       y=NULL)+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20))
```

## What if a social planner could reallocate workers between occupations?

-   Above we identified how much employment income would be expected to increase for an *individual* who went from being relatively well matched to relatively poorly matched.
-   Re social welfare, it is possible that increasing the match quality of a given individual may worsen the match quality of whoever they displaced when they shifted occupations.

## Simulation of improved matching:

```{r, fig.retina=2, fig.width=30, fig.height=10}
ggplot(simulation_results, aes(sim, mean_distance))+
  geom_line()+
  scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::comma)+
  labs(x="Simulation Number",
       y="Average skill gap distance",
       title="Shuffling occupations can reduce the average skill gap."
       )+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20))
```

## Distributional effect of swapping:

```{r, fig.retina=2, fig.width=30, fig.height=10}
ggplot(compare_swap, aes(exp(predictions), fill=data))+
  geom_density(alpha=.25)+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar)+
  labs(x="Predicted Employment Income")+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20))
```

## Second order stochastic dominance (SOSD):

```{r, fig.retina=2, fig.width=30, fig.height=10}
ggplot(compare_swap, aes(exp(predictions), colour = data)) +
  stat_ecdf()+
  scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::dollar)+
  annotate(geom = "text", x=60000, y=.22, label="a", size=10)+
  annotate(geom = "text", x=100000, y=.85, label="b", size=10)+
  labs(x="Predicted Employment Income",
       title="Second order stochastic dominance",
       subtitle="Given the area between the curves a is larger than area b, swapped SOSD original")+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20))
```

## Skill mis-match and full time full year employment:
